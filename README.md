To compile:
javac Calculator.java

To run:
java Calculator
```

#####Functions include: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
x the yth power, xth root of y, base 10 exponentation, log10, base e exp, 
ln (natural log), cos, sin, tan, acos, asin, atan, factorial, Del and Clr.

* Currently only works with mouse clicks. 
* You must click clear before next set of operations.
* Pressing of keys in in-fix order (as opposed to RPN/post-fix).
* xth root loses some precision with larger numbers. It is calculated using a quick and dirty approach: pow(x, 1.0/y)
* Trig functions are in radians.
* The 2 blank buttons don't do anything. Maybe add functionality in the future.
